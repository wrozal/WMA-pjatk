# Descriptors - identification and tracking of objects (saw)

1. For a saw image, e.g., saw1.jpg, identify a set of descriptors (can be SIFT, ORB, or other) - this will be the pattern,  
2. Find the object in another photo by comparing it with the pattern,  
3. For sawmovie.mp4, perform pattern tracking as above (for each frame of the video).
